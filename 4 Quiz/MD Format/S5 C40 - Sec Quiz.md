# Section Quiz – Mistake Proofing Strategies for Service Industries

---

### 1. What makes standardization such a strong prevention tool?

- A. It allows employees to improvise freely  
- B. It blocks unknown errors after they happen  
- C. Stops employees from taking any action  
- D. **It ensures every task follows a predictable pattern** ✅  

**Correct Answer:**  
**D. It ensures every task follows a predictable pattern**

**Explanation:**  
Standardization reduces variation, ensuring processes follow a set structure that reduces mistakes.

**Incorrect Options:**  
- **C. Stops action:** It guides, not blocks.  
- **A. Improvisation:** This invites inconsistency and errors.  
- **B. Blocks errors afterward:** That’s detection, not standardization.

### 2. Which mistake-proofing tool is used when a software platform warns users about mismatched data before submission?

- A. **Detection** ✅  
- B. Feedback loop  
- C. Error-blocking  
- D. Elimination  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A. Detection**

**Explanation:**  
The system checks and flags the error before the data is finalized—catching the mistake early.

**Incorrect Options:**  
- **B. Feedback loop:** That offers alerts post-submission or after actions.  
- **D. Elimination:** The task still exists—only the error is flagged.  
- **C. Error-blocking:** This doesn’t prevent submission—it flags issues.

### 3. Why is detection-based mistake-proofing essential even when prevention tools exist?

- A. It avoids creating too many alerts  
- B. It replaces the need for standardized processes  
- C. **It acts as a second layer when errors slip past prevention** ✅  
- D. It eliminates the need for automation  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C. It acts as a second layer when errors slip past prevention**

**Explanation:**  
Detection catches issues that prevention couldn’t block—ensuring layered protection.

**Incorrect Options:**  
- **A. Avoiding alerts:** Alerts are useful for detection.  
- **B. Replaces standardization:** Both approaches work together.  
- **D. Eliminates automation:** Automation often supports detection.

### 4. In an ambulance dispatch system, a software warning is triggered if two units are assigned to the same case. What does this represent?

- A. Elimination  
- B. Mitigation  
- C. **Detection** ✅  
- D. Facilitation  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C. Detection**

**Explanation:**  
The system identifies overlapping assignments early and warns users to correct the issue.

**Incorrect Options:**

- **D. Facilitation:** No guidance here—just warning.  
- **B. Mitigation:** It doesn’t reduce impact—it stops the error.

### 5. A supermarket website prevents checkout if an item is out of stock. This is an example of:

- A. Feedback loop  
- B. **Error-blocking** ✅  
- C. Detection  
- D. Replacement  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B. Error-blocking**

**Explanation:**  
The system blocks the transaction from proceeding with missing or invalid selections—removing the error possibility.

**Incorrect Options:**  
- **A. Feedback loop:** Would inform users without blocking.  
- **C. Detection:** Would catch after the attempt—not prevent it.  
- **D. Replacement:** No process was swapped or automated.
