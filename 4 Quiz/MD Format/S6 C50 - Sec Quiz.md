# Section Quiz – Step-By-Step Process of Implementing and Measuring Mistake Proofing Success

---

### 1. Which technique is most appropriate when an error is predictable and preventable through design?

- A. Alarms and warnings  
- B. Checklists and validation  
- C. **Physical or mechanical barriers** ✅  
- D. Go/No-Go controls  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C. Physical or mechanical barriers**

**Explanation:**  
These solutions eliminate the possibility of incorrect action by guiding users physically.

**Incorrect Options:**  
- **A. Alarms:** Signal an issue but don’t prevent the action.  
- **B. Checklists:** Help detect or confirm steps, not prevent wrong ones.  
- **D. Go/No-Go controls:** Block completion but don’t guide initial action.

### 2. A concert hall asks staff to label equipment before events. During a big show, the process is skipped because it takes too long. What mistake-proofing failure is this?

- A. Resistance  
- B. **Complexity** ✅  
- C. Invisibility  
- D. Oversight  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B. Complexity**

**Explanation:**  
If a system is too time-consuming, staff may skip it—making it ineffective.

**Incorrect Options:**  
- **A. Resistance:** Occurs when people don’t believe in the system—not when it's too slow.  
- **C. Invisibility:** Applies when people forget the system’s purpose—not when it’s avoided.  
- **D. Oversight:** Refers to missing steps accidentally, not intentionally skipping due to difficulty.

### 3. Why must mistake-proofing solutions be included in Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)?

- A. SOPs reduce the time needed to train new employees  
- B. SOPs eliminate the need for audits  
- C. **SOPs make mistake-proofing a formal job requirement** ✅  
- D. SOPs reduce management workload  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C. SOPs make mistake-proofing a formal job requirement**

**Explanation:**  
When mistake-proofing is documented in SOPs, it becomes a standard part of the job, not an optional extra.

**Incorrect Options:**  
- **A. Reducing training time:** May be a benefit but isn’t the main reason.  
- **B. Eliminating audits:** Audits are still required for oversight.  
- **D. Reducing workload:** Not the main purpose of SOP integration.

- B. It distracted drivers from routine work  
- C. **It built trust through direct experience** ✅  
- D. It eliminated the need for follow-up sessions  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C. It built trust through direct experience**

**Explanation:**  
Hands-on use lets employees see benefits in real time, leading to adoption and confidence.

**Incorrect Options:**  
- **A. Reduced paperwork:** Not mentioned or relevant to success.  
- **B. Distracting workers:** Incorrect—this increased engagement.  
- **D. No follow-ups:** Not the goal or guarantee of hands-on training.

- B. To review financial performance quarterly  
- C. **To continuously improve systems based on feedback** ✅  
- D. To reduce the number of SOPs  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C. To continuously improve systems based on feedback**

**Explanation:**  
PDCA supports mistake-proofing by encouraging small, ongoing refinements based on data and real-world use.

**Incorrect Options:**  
- **A. Shift schedules:** Unrelated to the PDCA purpose.  
- **B. Financial reviews:** Not linked to error prevention.  
- **D. SOP count:** PDCA doesn’t reduce SOPs; it improves process quality.
